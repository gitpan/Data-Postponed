Revision history for Data-Postponed

0.01    Somewhere around the middle of March, 2005.
  - First version, released on an unsuspecting world as Time-Traveler.

0.02    Mar 30, 2005
  - Renamed to Data-Postponed, rewrote the entire thing and wrote
    tests for nearly everything.

0.03    Mar 30, 2005
  - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to MANIFEST.
        Removed MANIFEST.SKIP from MANIFEST.

0.04    Mar 30, 2005
  - Fixed POD bug in Data::Postponed::Once. It was still named
    Data::Postponed::SemiStrict.
  - Split Data::Postponed::_ReadOnly::Array and ::Scalar off into
    separate files so search.cpan.org will render
    Data::Postpone::OnceOnly.pm's POD correctly.
  - Updated META.yml
  - Added DESTROY methods to all classes so it won't be
    AUTOLOADed. This is just a performance micro-optimization.

0.05    Mar 30, 2005
  - Fixed POD bug in Data::Postponed::OnceOnly. It was accidentally
    named Data::Postponed::Forever.
  - Moved Data::Postponed::_ReadOnly::Scalar back into ::OnceOnly and deleted
    Data::Postponed::_ReadOnly::Array.
